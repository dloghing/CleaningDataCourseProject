Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Either set the current working directory using setwd or uncomment the
line in the run_analysis function once a valid working directory is specified.

Source the script run_analysis.R with no arguments.  

The function run_analysis will return a table grouped by subject_id
and activity, with means of each variable column for the grouping.  

The data columns from the original data set are all of the mean and
standard deviation columns from the training and test sets.
