Study Design: 

The data set was retrieved from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The files used: 
In the top level directory: features.txt, activity_labels.txt
In train: X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt
In test: X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt

The data in the "Inertial Signals" directories were summarized in
X_train and X_test, according to the documentation accompanying the
data set.

Code Book

subject_id: integer.  Identifier of the study participant
activity_name: string Identifier of the study activity undertaken in the sample.
The possible values are: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

All remaining values are doubles (floating point).  They are the mean
values of the collection of measurements taken for each subject
engaging in one of the activities.   

The “mean” in the column names refers to the mean of the 128
measurements taken in each sample.  These were used as the data which
was grouped by subject_id and activity_name, so the columns in the
result set are a mean of the means from each measurement.   

Magnitude refers to value of the vector of the combined X,Y,Z
measurements. Units are not specified in the original documentation,
but are probably in Gs.  

Calculated Columns: 
tBodyAccMag-mean: Mean of the magnitude of body acceleration in the time domain
